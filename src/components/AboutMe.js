            <p className="paragraph1 mb-6 md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl">
                I am the kind of person who enjoys being among people and thinks highly of
                ideas being shared. I tackle difficulties with consideration and analysis
                since I have a preference for reason and logic over emotion and abstract thought.
                Sincere, perceptive, and independent, I can contribute my careful perspective
                and function effectively in a group setting.
                My quick wit and continual thinking mindset enable me to face
                difficulties logically because I'm constantly thinking and wondering,
                and my inclination for organized planning guarantees a methodical
                approach to achieve goals.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph2 md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl">
                I believe that I possess a dynamic combination of attributes
                that can help me to succeed both individually and as a team.
            </p>
